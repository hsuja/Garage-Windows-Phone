# Garage-Windows-Phone

Garage is a Javascript/HTML Windows Phone application that allows a user to track the fuel economy of his/her vehicles. 
A user could input the distance traveled and amount of fuel used while at a gas station, and the app can geotag the fill-up and store fuel up information in a database.
This particular database was the Google Datastore, and the app interacted with the datastore via a web API (See the Fuel-Economy-Web-API repository for the implementation of the back end).
